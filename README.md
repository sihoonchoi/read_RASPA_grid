# Read and Extract RASPA Grids
A high-throughput script for efficiently reading, parsing, and extracting data from RASPA GRID files

## How to Use

1. Move all `*.c` files into the `RASPA2/src/` directory.  
2. Compile the source files. Example commands:
   ```bash
   gcc -o readVDWGrid readVDWGrid.c
   gcc -o readCoulombGrid readCoulombGrid.c
  ```
3. Run the executables to extract the grid data:
  ```bash
  ./readVDWGrid FILENAME
  ./readCoulombGrid FILENAME
  ```
  - `FILENAME` should be the name of a GRID file generated by RASPA.
  - The output will be a text file named `FILENAME.txt`, containing the extracted grid data in plain numerical format.
  - `./readVDWGrid` processes van der Waals (VDW) grids.
  - `./readCoulombGrid` processes Coulomb grids.
