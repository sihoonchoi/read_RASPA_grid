# Read and Extract RASPA Grids
A high-throughput script for efficiently reading, parsing, and extracting data from RASPA GRID files

## How to Use

1. Move all `*.c` files into the `src/` directory.  
2. Compile the source files. Example commands:
   ```bash
   gcc -o readVDWGrid readVDWGrid.c
   gcc -o readCoulombGrid readCoulombGrid.c
  ```
3. Run the executables to extract the grid data:
  ```bash
  ./readVDWGrid
  ./readCoulombGrid
  ```
  `readVDWGrid` will extract the van der Waals (VDW) grid, and `readCoulombGrid` will extract the Coulomb grid, both generated by RASPA
